## Introduction

templUI is a growing collection of beautifully designed components built with templ and Tailwind CSS. Install components via CLI or copy the source directly. Everything is customizable, type-safe, and yours to own.

**CLI-first workflow.** Install with one command. Full control over your code. Follow our [releases](https://github.com/templui/templui/releases) to see what's new.

## Why templUI

Heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), templUI brings the same philosophy to Go developers. Install via CLI, customize everything, own your code – no hidden dependencies.

Every component is designed to be beautiful by default, fully accessible, and CSP compliant. No magic, no hidden complexity – just clean, customizable code that works.

## Vision & Roadmap

templUI embraces Go's philosophy: simple, reliable, and performant. We're building a component library that feels native to Go developers – with server-side rendering at its core and progressive enhancement where it matters.

Our roadmap focuses on expanding the component library while maintaining our core principles: type safety, zero dependencies, and developer experience. This is the UI toolkit Go developers actually want to use.
